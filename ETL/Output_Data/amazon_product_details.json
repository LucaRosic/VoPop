            "Review Text": "Unlike the official Samsung wireless pad, this wireless charging pad does not contain a fan. However, despite the lack of fan, I have not run into any particular heat issues when it comes to wireless charging. Although the device and pad get slightly warm when in use, neither of them have been concerningly warm to date.\n\nThe rubber surface is nice for keeping the phone aligned to the charger's coil, and the charger itself on the table, although the uniformity of both rubber surfaces makes it slightly difficult to tell which way is up, and I nearly set it on the table upside-down after cleaning. The rubber surfaces also have a habit of sticking to dust very easily. I found the charger to be very dusty within a day or so of using it on a mostly clean room. Fortunately, the dust seems to be fairly easily remedied by a quick wipe-down with a damp cloth, although I do not know if this is a recommended method of cleaning the charger.\n\nAn issue that I have with the charger is that the LED is difficult to see, and is often covered by a phone if it is being used, thereby defeating the point of the LED in the first place. This makes it difficult to tell whether a phone is charging, misaligned, or if there are any issues with the wireless charger, without rotating or removing the phone, the former of which is not suitable if the charger is in a more awkward location, and the latter causes the charger to shut off within moments, making removing the phone to see the LED useless.\n\nThe wireless charger also does not seem to have any issues when it comes to thicker cases. I use an Otterbox Defender case on my phone, and I have not experienced any issues with charging the phone through the case.",

If you want to take full advantage of Quick charge, you will need a Quickcharge 2.0 or greater adapter.
