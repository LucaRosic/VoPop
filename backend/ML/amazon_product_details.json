I\u2019ve barely put it down and it was definitely worth every penny. The charge is literally unbeatable, the quality is impeccable, there are so many free books with kindle unlimited and honestly I do recommend getting the kindle case and charging stand. Both products are worth the little bit extra with the bundle price. If you are on the fence, take the leap bc I promise you won\u2019t regret it."

I bought this newer version of Kindle thinking it would be an improvement over my last Kindle, but if anything this \"new version\" is an inferior product compared to the older version I had, in my opinion. PRO: I do like the cover that came with the Kindle bundle I purchased and the charging cradle which is why I gave a three, otherwise I was going to give it two stars. Final thoughts: I don't like the Kindle product at all at this point. Unfortunately, most of my digital books I bought on Amazon so I am stuck with it until I take the time to look for a better alternative."

The least Anker could do is create a USB-to-Fintstone-days adapter so that we could power the charging stand as if we're in 2024).\n\nThe Kindle button is STILL not recessed, so easy accidental powering off is still a thing. As it has been for every. Kindle. Ever. The Paperwhite's display is fine."

Fortunately, I don\u2019t have any concerns about that happening any time soon. The kit felt worth it to me as I wanted the cordless charging stand and I was noncommittal to a case at the time and just wanted something protective. I did soon learn that a different style case suited my needs better and ordered something different but the one I picked to go with it was good quality, pretty, and suited it\u2019s purpose."

The screen is great for outside reading which the Fires were not. I also appreciate all the adjustments I am able to make to accommodate any light in which I am reading. The only negative is that I prefer white letters on black background. In this feature, the letters are not as sharp on the Paperwhite as on the Fire so I am unable to use white on black while reading in bed. Still highly recommend!"

This is just such a substantial upgrade and while it may seem having a dedicated device just to read is not necessary it really makes a big difference. The device is well-made and set up was quick and easy. Readability rather inside or outside and full sun was excellent. Its overall size is also great for travel and it is light weight. Would recommend for all avid readers."

I enjoy reading on it and the convenience of purchasing books on Amazon but it\u2019s not worth it for a completely unreasonable lifespan.

Opening the box brought forth a light like unto a warm summer's day, yea verily, like unto the soft kiss of a summer's promised love. The e-reader sat upon a cloud made of the happy wag of a puppies' tails and unicorn kisses, held firmly but softly, like a hard-boiled egg in a cup made of fine china, not clinging like a castaway in a storm but a gentle hand, as to that of a mother and her child. Dare I say a moment of purest joy emanated from my heart, the love poets often try to describe in their verse, or a painter captures in the strokes of their brush, yet still often eludes. Had I the words to express the glory of Amazon, I would put it so forth onto paper, electronic or the compressed wood pulp of yore. But I am simple man, who loves the bibliographical, and can only hope to delve into but a splinter of the sum of all written literature before being shuffled off this mortal coil by hands of those beings only dimly imagined."

I chose The signature for the storage capacity and battery life. It'll go all week without a charge and I haven't worried about the storage space yet at 500 books. It's been great, I can read wherever I'm at and I've started to use the Kindle even at home. I still buy some favorite books in paper, but not all of them so this is saving me so much space on my shelves too. I should've bought one years earlier."

I can read in bed now with the light off while my wife sleeps, or in a darker room without having to worry about lighting. Definitely the best feature. I also got the case and stand up charger for it. This Paperwhite Kindle holds a charge for a long time. I'd say you can read a book or two without even charging it. The only thing I'm still getting used to is turning the page. Sometimes when I flick my finger to turn the page, it will turn several pages. I think I just have to get used to it."

Another reason why I bought it instead a tablet or iPad was to get away from technology and just enjoy ready which the kindle lets me do just that.

I said a great kindle for a niche group. The reason I wanted this kindle was to read at night without waking up my wife.

I got a little cover and another stand charging thing as part of a \u201cpackage\u201d. I like the cover to protect it but the stand charger is a waste for me. I never use it. I am surprised that I still get Kindle version books from the library versus hardbacks because I don\u2019t have to go get them! LOL. I\u2019m a \u201clate to the Kindle party\u201d convert. The only thing that feels \u201ccludgy\u201d is navigating back and remembering the \u201ccontrols\u201d of the touch screen. The Kindle app on the ipad was much easier to navigate. I found it harder to set up permanent choices for font, etc. Also the power button is on the bottom where I accidentally turn it off if I rest the Kindle on my belly in bed. LOL"
