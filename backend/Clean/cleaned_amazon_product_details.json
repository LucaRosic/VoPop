My wife thinks I have a problem. I think shell leave me and take the kids. She thinks that using chilli oil is an insult to her cooking. And it makes me gassy, and I smell like something has died inside of me.\n\nI got off track. Oil is great. Too expensive to use it like I want to. Ill have to remortgage the house to buy more after my wife takes the kids to her mums.",
