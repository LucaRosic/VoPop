You will need to Download the Smart life app to set up the device but it's very easy. Feels good quality too, these was only a couple of devices it won't work with like my defuser as it needs to be turned on with its own switch but apart from that everything else works."

Similarly needed a few attempts to link to Google Home. But once set up it works well. They are a great size and allow you to use all sockets on a multi plug."

They do take a bit of time to set up, not overly difficult, have created a few routines with them.I'd rate them 4.5 stars though (If i could) as set up did take a little bit of learning, once you understand how they work though it's easy enough."

Not too big and only takes up one plug space.\nCons: Could not download required app. From the literature provided this is a known issue, however the suggested work around is to download an alternative app that also was unable to download.\nEventually downloaded app on an old phone and \"shared\" with new phone in order to access. App has absolutely horrendous UI but have managed to get plug programmed. Have been unsuccessful linking plug with Google home.\nRecommend getting an alternate brand if you're not concerned about plug size."

The maximum brighness of the LED is not even nearly enough to call it a night lamp, as they advertise. But yes, it is a luminated rings, which looks nice on its own. With the google home app, one switch got divided into three segments. two of them is light and one plug. And even though you just tap to close the light, it will shut off the whole system. But With their own app, this works fine. If you are invested in google system already. this plugs are not for you. :)"

Took a while but it paired, best to do this close to your router, especially if there's a software update like I had. Trick is to understand this is really two devices, a plug and a (circular ring) light. Need to name them differently to use voice commands. Worked straight up with Alexa. Can set up timers or a \"Scene\", which I did so that the light turned on/off with the plug (if/then commands). Android App has on/off widget which is great. Light isn't real bright, not as strong as a \"night light\". Can fit two side by side in Oz power point. Great device."

Not clear from the start that you need to use the 2G network and then you have to check to see if your router can handle that and 5G simultaneously.\n\nI just wanted a device to switch two devices on at a certain time and off a few hours later and spent some time trying to set this up. I think I have succeeded with one but I need to push the little button on the side of the device to connect to the network and hence turn the heater on.....\n\nI suspect this means I still have not got the connection process correct.\n\nOne difficulty was that the language default was Mandarin(?) and despite changing to English and restarting, the device names remain in the original language - but most of the app text is english.\n\nAlso assumed that it would easily connect to ALEXA but they were not recognised. Then discovered when my network did connect them, that Alexa was irrelevant.\n\nSo altogether frustrating but it seems like a too much trouble to return them"
