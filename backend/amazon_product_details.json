            "Review Text": "I've had several fitness and smartwatches over the years, but the Apple Watch SE truly stands out. This watch is incredibly accurate in tracking active calories burned, which has been essential for maintaining my calorie deficit eating plan. The heart rate monitoring, especially during my morning cardio workouts, is spot on. The look and fit of the band are excellent, although there's a bit of a learning curve to fastening it securely, but once it's on, it stays put.\n\nOne minor drawback is the battery life; it does tend to be quite power-hungry. After watching a few YouTube videos and tweaking some settings, I managed to conserve battery life more effectively. However, you'll still need to charge it daily for about an hour. Despite this, the features and accuracy of the Apple Watch SE make it a worthy investment, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable fitness partner and stylish accessory."

            "Review Text": "I'm absolutely thrilled with my Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) purchase! After comparing prices across multiple sellers, I found an unbeatable deal here that made this already affordable smartwatch an even better value.\nThe SE (2nd Gen) packs most of the essential features you'd want in a smartwatch without the premium price tag of the higher-end models. It tracks my workouts, monitors my heart rate, and even detects falls - all while seamlessly syncing with my iPhone.\nThe battery life is impressive, easily lasting me through a full day of use. The retina display is crisp and bright, making it easy to read notifications and track my fitness goals at a glance.\nWhat really sets this purchase apart is the price. I saved a significant amount compared to other retailers, making this smartwatch an absolute steal. If you're in the market for a reliable, feature-rich Apple Watch without breaking the bank, look no further than this listing for the SE (2nd Gen).\nIn summary: top-notch quality, all the essential features, and an unbeatable price. Five stars all the way!"

The only annoying thing is that the charger it came with does not work very well and Amazon told me I either had to send back the whole thing, or nothing. So I ended up having to buy a two pack of chargers. They work great."

I found the major difference for this model and the series 9 is the \u201cAlways On\u201d feature and heart monitoring. Personally, I can set the screen to stay on for 90 seconds which is plenty of time to figure out what time it is. I also don\u2019t need that in depth heart tracking\u2026 Overall great price for a smart watch and shipping was fast and easy!!"

            "Review Text": "I bought this watch for my father who is having some vertigo and lives alone. This watch can tell if the person wearing it has taken a hard fall and it will call 911 if the person does not respond within a short period of time. The watch will also call any persons designated on the iPhone health app as emergency contacts. I set both these features up on the phone and if you need instructions you should be able to find these on the web easily enough; I followed a video on YouTube.\n\nI personally have an AmazFit watch which I really like because it helps me track my steps and alerts me to stand up and move every hour. I can easily set goals and track my progress daily and it also tracks my heart rate and sleep patterns. The Apple watch may ultimately be able to do some of these things too through the health application, but the appl is a bit of a rabbit hole and I was unable to set it up for my dad. Standing and moving for a few minutes every hour is a good health goal and I hoped the Apple Watch would alert him to do this (as my far cheaper watch does). It may very well be out there somewhere, but I could not find it. Please comment with instructions if you know how.\n\nThe Apple watch is otherwise terrific in so many ways. One can set up alerts for taking medication, it will track and alert heart rate and warn you if it is going to high or low. My dad was using it with voice commands within a day of setting it up. You do not have to say, hey Siri, just hold in the button and say call 'x' and you can just talk the person right from your watches speaker phone which works great. You can likewise set and appointment or alarm and other voice commands in similar fashion. This is particularly helpful for tired old fingers; no searching or typing required."

            "Review Text": "I did a lot of research on the most accurate fitness tracker and found that Apple watches do very well, better than most others, when tested against real medical equipment. The SE 2nd gen is the cheapest one that has all the same sensors as the newer, significantly more expensive models (minus the single lead EKG on the newest models, but that wasn't worth the many hundreds extra to me). I've had mine now for a couple months and couldn't be happier. I only cared about the fitness tracking features, but I have to say I'm a fan of getting notifications through the watch for messages and emails. It's nice to be able to leave my phone sitting somewhere away from me in a room and not have to go by to tap on it every once in a while to see if I missed any messages (I always leave my phone on silent and don't always hear the buzz of it vibrating if I have music on or something). Having all the metrics for my workouts and even just my normal day to day stuff like the step tracker is worth its weight in gold to me. Couldn't be happier with this purchase."

            "Review Text": "Convenience is the name of the game here. The ability to use my iPhone without having to pull it out of my pocket or holster. A hands free option to take or make phone calls and texts. The ability to view my health/exercise data while on the move without reaching for my iPhone. Being able to control my music while listening, here again while on the move without grabbing my phone. Getting a look at the time and using Apple Pay without pulling out my phone. So much this watch does and more\u2026. So much convenience built in. The only downside is that it drains my phones battery much quicker, I find myself limiting the time I use the watch each day to the times it would bring the most convenience, then turning my iPhones Bluetooth off to give me better battery life for the day. I didn\u2019t want cellular due to the extra cost it would impose on my monthly phone bill. The fitness tracker part of the watch still does work without using my phone so Bluetooth isn\u2019t necessary while wearing it, but I lose all the other nice functions. The reality is one must plan the watches usage throughout the day to where you get the best battery usage out of both phone and watch\u2026. I\u2019ve been able to stretch the watches battery to about 48 hours through thrifty use of the watch while preserving my phones daily battery life."

The durability of the watch itself is pretty good, but i work at a brewery so i bought case for it and it\u2019s been phenomenal ever since. Hooking it up to my phone was a breeze, it prompts you to install the newest software which only takes a few minutes. Phone calls on this thing is pretty good, sound quality and mic are great. I went with the 44mm option so i could see the screen a little better but whatever floats your boat.\n\nOverall if you\u2019re looking for a low-budget option, this may be the way to go. Would definitely recommend."

I was surprised that the watch battery does not last a day, and should be charged every day or night. Charging is pretty fast. My Garmin watch allowed me to turn GPS off, and on only when needed for activities. When Garmin GPS is off the battery lasts a week. The Apple watch band is comfortable and easy to clasp on the wrist. There are many choices for watch face style per individual taste. I\u2019m happy overall with the watch."

This new one, in black, is a bit smaller with a nicer (black) band that was easy to slip on. Everything transferred over and seems about the same. I have one complaint. The charger that comes with it needs a special adapter, which must be ordered from Apple for an extra $20. The charger for the old watch works, but it is unreliable, which is why I got a new watch. Having to order an extra part made me angry. However, Apple support was easy to contact and very nice. So, five stars."

The screen on the watch is brighter than I expected and the sensitivity of the watch face is lovely.
