My old Black and Decker waffle iron was well built - heavy cage, heavy grill plates , good controls and produced excellent waffles. This machine is flimsy by comparison -- though it's design is very close to the old one. The heating is uneven and produced waffles that went from overdone to underdone depending on which side you looked at. I am disappointed that Amazon even carries this item."

The non stick top and bottom make this easy to clean. The light turns from red to white to give me a good indication of whether it's hot enough to cook with yet. Then I can choose different temperatures to so I can choose the right temperature for me to cook with.\n\nThe only downside I would say is that the top and bottom sometimes pop off when I'm cooking waffles and I need to pop them back into place. Aside from that, this simple to use, easy to clean, and it's helped me find my love for waffles all over again.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope this helps :)"

            "Review Text": "I bought this particular waffle iron recently because I had the same one many years ago and it worked perfectly. It's the only style I've found where you can switch to either grill or make waffles and the plates can be removed for easier cleaning. But this new one I bought doesn't work as well because the plates pop out. I've seen other reviews complaining about this. The clips don't hold the plates in securely enough. When you insert the bottom plate in, the heating control mechanism inside pushes it up. The inside mechanism is designed with springs to push down when you insert the bottom plate, but apparently the springs are too strong and they push the plate back up out of the clip. So when a waffle is ready to be removed, I have to hold the plates in with potholders so that the plates separate from the waffle. I'm thinking of returning it because I've seen other reviews saying that the plates pop out, but I'm guessing this would be a problem with any replacement that I would receive. I really want this to work and I'm planning to call Black & Decker to see if they've got a fix for this."

It heat more evenly and the waffle are crisp and browned to just the right color. Takes less time to heat up.\nmy only problem with them is the hinge spread over time. I mean over 5 or ten years. They have never stopped working but kind just got old. So i have had to replace them. Over all a good product."

As others have noted, when heated to Waffle setting, the lower plate pops up (disengages) from the clip, making it unsafe and impossible to use. I also found that the plates on this appliance weigh less than those on my old one and the item has a slightly cheaper feel. I even tried heating it with my old heavier plates attached but the lower one still pops off when hot. Some reviewers reported a positive experience so unsure if the one I received happens to be defective or if this is a new design flaw, but I will definitely be returning it as it is totally useless."

The plates are not non-stick like the listing claims. Cooking waffles is such a hassle (the lid is heavy and the handle to lift the lid is slippery and small, the clips holding the cooking plates will unclip in the middle of cooking which is a safety hazard) that I cannot recommend this product.\n\nAlso like other reviews have stated, it\u2019s VERY unstable. The \u201cfeet\u201d on the unit (if you can even call little stubs feet) do not have rubber on them or anything. Trying to lift the heavy lid when cooking and it\u2019s very hot is near impossible, the black handle on the top slips every time and will either push the unit backwards or it will start to open and then slip crashing back down.\n\nAlso the lid never seemed stable. It just would lean back precariously like it was on the brink of crashing backwards if given the slightest push.\n\nI like the fact that the plates are removable, however, the \u201cclips\u201d that are meant to hold the plates in place DO NOT WORK. I had to physically pull the clips for the top and the bottom down because they wouldn\u2019t hold the cooking plates in place. Terrible design choice, especially if you\u2019re cooking and it\u2019s around 400* and the clip decides to pop off. Complete safety hazard.\n\nDecided to return this unit and instead purchased a Cuisinart panini grill with removable plates. Have used it already and it\u2019s a night and day difference. If buying a small sandwich grill, it\u2019s important to get a unit with removable plates, otherwise it\u2019s a pain to clean. The plates on the Cuisinart lock securely in place and are a breeze to take out. The non-stick feature works great instantly and when hand washing the plates, they clean in SECONDS. The quality is literally NIGHT and DAY. Don\u2019t waste your money on the Black and Decker as you won\u2019t be happy with it and you could possibly get hurt. I would recommend getting the Cuisinart instead. It\u2019s a little bit more expensive but it\u2019s worth it in the end.\n\nHope this helps anyone looking for a reliable indoor grill."

The waffles come out crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. I like that it makes basically 4 waffles at a time. That way a couple people can start eating while you're making more. The iron takes a while to heat up, but if you start heating and then make your batter, it works out well. One important note (and not mentioned in the instructions), the indicator light comes back on when the waffle is done cooking, which is helpful. :-)"

At first i thought I just didn't put them in right . but no matter what i did they pop out when hot and you have to risk a burn trying to put them back in . only to have them come loose again. I will definitely be returning I thought Black and Decker was a little better then this piece of trash"

It ticked all the buttons of what my friend was looking for and she has years of being in the kitchen. She wanted to be able to make old fashion waffels for the grand kids. She said the first couple uses she fid have issue with bottom plate being loose but once she learned her way around that she is thoroughly pleased with the functioning of the unit over all."

The housing and clips that are supposed to retain the plates are very flimsy. The retention clip for the upper plate failed this morning while my 10-year-old and I were making waffles. The hot upper plate fell out of the housing as he was lifting the lid to check if the waffle was done cooking. Fortunately, the plate bounced but was prevented from falling completely out by the waffle. After it had cooled down, I attempted to reattach the plate, but the housing where the retention clip attaches and the clip itself flex too much to retain the plate. Frankly, this product should be recalled. I will be reaching out to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. Do not buy."

This is the 4th time I've purchased this item for use in various locales. The style has always been marginal, but useable. The price has gone way up in the past 3 years, but that is to be expected under the current fiscal policy. Unfortunately, quality control has also disappeared. The cooking plates spontaneously pop out in use, ruining the waffle. The non-stick coating has several flaws. The stainless steel was marred right out of the box. I returned it after one use and may have to learn to like the Belgian variety!"

(I've since learned that an advantage to having fixed plates is temperature consistency). The ring burner cooks hotter on the outside of the ring on top and hotter on the inside of the ring on the bottom. The metal case is thin and gets hot. The light only serves to let you know when preheating is complete, even though it continues to go off and on throught cooking. I'm returning it. Don't need a griddle so will try a closed system waffle maker. I was excited to try this because I don't prefer Belgian style waffles and there are very few waffle irons available that are for the thinner type."

Cheap piece of garbage, no shielding from the heating element and the outside body makes the outside get just as hot as the cooking plates. If it had proper handles I might overlook this but it just has a thin piece of plastic on the lid, that also gets warm during cooking by the way giving it a melting plastic smell.\nPlates are only held on by a single thin metal clip that warps in the heat and results in the plates always falling off.\n\nI saw reviews for this on websites recommending this as a good low/mid price range waffle maker and I have other black & decker kitchen appliances that I love. I will be immediately asking for a refund, if this was $15-$25 I might excuse the cheap design but at $60+ it's a rip off."
