            "Review Text": "I was initially disappointed with this oil because I was expecting with more crunch. But as I\u2019ve used it more, I\u2019ve come to really like it. I just use a tiny amount to enhance flavours as I can\u2019t tolerate too much chilli. It\u2019s actually quite good."

I was expecting the garlic and onion pieces to be crunchy but most of the ingredients were chewy and the garlic still had quite a raw uncooked flavour to it.\n\nThe oil flavour itself is nice but the texture isn\u2019t what I\u2019d describe as \u201cCrispy\u201d"

My wife thinks I have a problem. I think she\u2019ll leave me and take the kids. She thinks that using chilli oil is an insult to her cooking. And it makes me gassy, and I smell like something has died inside of me.\n\nI got off track. Oil is great. Too expensive to use it like I want to. I\u2019ll have to remortgage the house to buy more after my wife takes the kids to her mums."
