I like to keep a bottle by my bed side at night, so I have some water nearby if I feel the need for a sip in the middle of the night, or when I wake up in the morning. It keeps the water temperature in check over night, whether it is cold or hot. Perfect for both summer and winter. Also it has a handle for easy carry, I just take in around the house, so I can stay hydrated without having to get water from the kitchen."

I much prefer the chug lid of my yeti. I have to use this without any of the provided options and it's awkward and can't drink while driving. I'll prob buy something better."

BUT I should not burn my mouth drinking from a water bottle that is apparently triple isolated, protected in a neoprene sleeve and left in a light coloured cottone tote bag in the car. And no I didn't fill it with hot water. The water was fresh and cool when I left the car. But a few hours later and 20min into my drive home I was desperate for a refreshing sip. Luke warm would have been okay but I don't need a hot tea without teabag at 32C outside. I was going to buy the larger version for my partner. Boy am I glad I didn't. I know it's not a Stanley or CamelBak but I think a plastic bottle would have been better then this."

Very conviement especially with the carry bag and would definitely recommend!"

We left ice in it and it lasted from like 3pm until around noon the next day. Awesome bottles!! I decided to get my own and am super happy with the colour and how much it comes with, but my straw lid (main lid I would be using) leaks pretty badly. Not sure what happened because my husband's doesn't leak at all. Really disappointed that my favourite lid is the one I can't use, but very happy otherwise."

I don't have to worry much about dropping it or how heavy it is because that sleeve makes sure it doesn't fall off of my hand. Not bad in terms of weight, quality, and I'd day it's pretty durable from the amount of times I've dropped it. Not a single dent yet. A nice touch, but the sleeve hasn't shrank in the washer yet! 5 stars"

I ordered the indigo black and received the bubble gum. Definitely not feeling the bubble gum colour. Hopefully the new order I've placed is the correct colour so I can review the coolflask \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb.\nUpdate 4th Aug 24.\nSo I ordered the coolflask again in indigo black after having received the wrong colour first time round ,and yet again i received the bubble gum colour which I will be returning (again) . Please be aware that the second order DOES state the colour as indigo black on the box so I'd say that a major mix up in the packaging department is to blame. Overall a rubbish experience but I guess these things do occur some times. Don't let this experience I've had put you off as it does seem to be a very good product. It just could be a lucky dip regarding what colour you end up with \ud83e\udd23."

Canada, through one of the hottest summers we have ever had, I take it with me absolutely everywhere, carrying it with its case and sling is absolutely easy.It holds 2.2L liters of water \ud83d\udca7 \ud83d\udc99 And I have had ice stay in it for UP to 50 hours before almost melting, and the water's still being cold. It is absolutely great and very well. Insulated, very tough and all the attachments for the drinking part are absolutely amazing depending on what I am doing for the day! This company is Way underpricing what this water bottle should be. Congratulations to them for saving the environment. And I hope more of these get sold, I will be buying 1 for my girlfriend and more for my family And hers as well, I think i'm going to collect a couple of them, to be honest, they look absolutely stunning and the quality is absolutely unbelievable.Very well done."

If you are thinking this is a y**I, it's not even in the same league.\n\nIt won't get super cold (too little insulation) and the top is really too small of an opening to easily get ice in it.\n\nTo their credit, there are a bunch of straps and types of tops to loose before you use them but please be very careful of the default top as it absolutely needs the straw thing to work and the straw thing loves to fall off and roll places when you're filling it.\n\nAll in all, a stainless (or maybe it's just aluminum) container for under 30 isn't bad these days but this is not really any better than wrapping a 2L bottle in a towel at the beach - just know what you're getting."

The main issue is that the straw makes an extremely loud, annoying noise when I try to drink from it. It makes a high-pitched squeaking sound that is frankly unbearable. I've tried adjusting the straw, cleaning it, and everything else I can think of, but the noise persists.\n\nOn top of that, about a replacement, as this seems to be a manufacturing defect, but they said the product is non-returnable. So I'm stuck with a waterbottle that I can't even use because the straw is defective.\n\nI would not recommend this waterbottle to anyone. The noisy straw makes it completely unusable, and the lack of a return/replacement policy is very frustrating. Save your money and buy a different brand that actually works properly. This has been a very disappointing purchase."
