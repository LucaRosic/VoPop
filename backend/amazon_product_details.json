My expectations of a preowned device is that it actually has a use. This is just a brick. Apple won\u2019t unlock it. Just going to a landfill like many others I suspect. Seems like that goes against Amazon Renewed mantra to me. Apple should also have some better way to manage this."

He seems to like this one pretty well. The only complaint we had was the size of the watch band. It was terribly small and had to be replaced with a larger one. That is why I rated the watch 4 stars instead of 5. I got a good deal on the watch, so having to purchase another band was not a deal breaker."

So glad I did. This watch functions with great accuracy and no weird glitches. The only negative is the shorter battery life compared to other watches. I just make sure to charge it while sleeping and if I forget it only takes an hour or two to get a full charge."

Went to the Apple store for a free class and discovered that our teacher had the same watch. I don't need all the fancy things a watch can do these days - but at the right price, this is the same price as a Fit Bit and does so much more. My watch doesn't have cellular capability, so the phone has to be within 30-40 feet - but if I'm busy I can answer calls on it! Read messages, emails, keep track of steps, sleep; easily change watch faces to match mood or outfit. And, I can see the time and all writing outside in the sunlight. Great improvement over my last FitBit. Great product."

            "Review Text": "It\u2019s a great beginner watch for those that never had an Apple Watch before to become familiar with it. I gave it 4 starts because it doesn\u2019t come with a keyboard. That\u2019s my fault because I didn\u2019t do research before purchasing. The Series 7, 8 and 9 comes with keyboards. The SE 2nd generation only allows you to scribble to text or voice to text. Apart from that I have no complaints. The battery is long lasting though I mainly just use it at work. I will probably upgrade to one of the watch series that offers keyboard use unless Apple decides to bring out an update for this one"

            "Review Text": "For years I put off getting an Apple watch because I didn't think it would compare to my Garmin watches or be as tough as my G-Shocks. While some of that is true this is still an item that I found to be worth the purchase. It is my go to watch at the office because it helps me keep up with meetings, texts, phone calls and what my kids are up to (i.e. location services). Because of the Apple watch I also find that I am not constantly grabbing my phone as most things I can simply turn my wrist to see and respond to. The only reason it was not a 5 star for me is you pretty much have to charge it each night. Not a deal breaker for me as I am not looking to sleep in it anyway but better battery life would be nice. Really easy to use and there are lots of channels like \"Watch Jumble\" on YT that provide easy step by step directions to get you started. Well worth it, I wish I would have bought one earlier."
