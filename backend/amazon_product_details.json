Mops, brushes, filters etc.\nAmazon sell only the brushes for the M1.\nBut the mops and filters are only available, on Amazon, through copy Chinese Sellers and they don't look the right shape.\nIf you go directly to the Lefant Site you can add these replacement accessories to your cart but upon check-out Australia is NOT available !!\nLooks like I might need to return the M1."

The battery gets through a whole House clean and it will recharge itself when low. The mop function is better than nothing but it won't change your life.\n\nOverall it performs well 80% of the time, occasionally it will forget where to charge or will clean a room for 60 seconds before going back to recharge."

I was still going to keep it, but after testing and comparing decided to return (by the way, still waiting for the refund 10 days after posting!).\n\nHere is my impressions about this vacuum:\n\n- It really struggles with mapping and often creates another mirrored map (see the picture).\n- Not the best climber comparing to Roborock S7 and Dreame D9 Max that I bought instead.\n- Pattern of vacuuming may be a bit chaotic.\n- Often struggles returning to charge even after being manually placed next to the charger.\n- Still does a good job on the hard floors and ok on the rugs (I would buy it for the big carpeted home yet!).\n- Small, compact and light, but built quality can hardly compete with some other models such as the Roborock.\n- Seller contacted me and offered the complimentary parts; it was nice but a bit useless considering that I decided to return the product.\n- They were still demanding to send them some videos although I mentioned a few times that the vacuum was posted back to Amazon.\n- All in all, even for $259 it\u2019s not the best value, although it might be an option for under $200.\n\nPS I purchased this model after looking at some positive reviews on YouTube but my impression was very different. Will still give 3 stars considering some positive features."

As long as you remove general obstacles (especially wires), M1 will cutely and automatically find its way. After a week, received the OTA update and saw that the M1's performance improved. Have not tried the mopping feature yet (as my house is mostly carpet). Able to identify stairs and find its way around chair legs. I have to clean the waste bin manually, but it's very easy to do. Very happy with the purchase. Value for money!"

It was very well packed and we are impressed with the quality of the unit for what it cost us. The mapping function seems very intelligent so far. The app is user friendly. Great for a house with 3 cats and a dog as it cleans up lots of unseen dust and hair! Have not tried the mopping feature yet but very impressed with all features so far. The battery life has also impressed us as we have a large floor space to cover. We love our new member of the family, Lefant!"

Whilst it doesn\u2019t have a self empty station, the charging dock is small enough to fit nicely under the sideboard so the robot is nice and hidden away. With regular vacuuming, the unit only needs to be emptied about once a week. It is great for picking up surface dust/debris off carpet but definitely still a place for a once a week go over with my stick vacuum. If a bulk of your house is hard floor like ours, it\u2019s certainly worth the money. Navigates well under dining chairs to do a good enough job under the table after my messy little kids. Haven\u2019t tried the mopping function yet but I only purchased for vacuuming anyway anticipating I\u2019ll still need to do a weekly go over with the proper mop."

Not only is it cleaning my home fastidiously but it's also enticing me to keep my home cleaner where it can't reach.\nI have laminate flooring throughout with one rug and then M1 easily breezes through on the lowest setting and removes all dust and dirt. When I follow up with the mopping function the mop barely gets dirty, that's how clean the floors are.\nFiguring out the mapping was a little difficult, particularly because it was important to me that the direction of the sweeping and mopping is the same as the floor boards. The M1 kept reverting to a perpendicular pattern until I played around with the location of the docking station. Once I found a location that enticed the robot to follow the alignment of the floorboards I was able to place the docking station in the location I favoured for it, and the robot still maintains the direction.\nOverall, I'm very happy with my purchase. It might be a little louder than I wish for, but the app allows me to sufficiently direct the robot from afar, so I can run it in any capacity while not at home."

This is very good for the cheapo price (sub $300 AUD) when this item is 50% off.\n\nWhen doing its first map, you must remove all obstructions, put all chairs up e.t.c but after that it will navigate around all obstructions very well. It has not gotten lost or stuck once. Auto map save is OFF by default, so first thing you must do is go into 'map management' in the app and turn Map Save to ON.\n\nNo go zones works perfectly, but the room splitting function in the app is clunky. You only have to do it once I guess. And you will have to do it, as the first mapping will combine some rooms that need to be split.\n\nI have no idea how the mopping aspect works. Lets be real these vacs that drag a pad behind are not real mopping vacs, that's why it's so cheap. If you want a real mopping vac you need to get one with the spinning mops and the base station mop washer at 4x the price or more.\n\nWhy 4 stars? Well the rated battery and cleaning time does not even come close to what is listed, even on lowest power mode. The rated battery on the description is 4000 mAh. But when I look up replacement batteries for this vac they are all 2600 mAh. So I suspect if we open it up to change the battery we will see a 2600, not a 4000. But at this price you cannot complain too much."

But it has been remarkable!\n\nThe LiDar technology and mapping function is great, it effectively maps all 3 levels of my house and vaccums each room sequentially and methodically, not just in random patters like other cheaper models do. You have to turn the 'auto save' button on to save the map, then you can pick to use whichever map you have saved. It has a really good anti-collision system and sensors to avoid falling down stairs, goes right to the edge of the stairs which I love so it doesn't miss a spot.\n\nThe suction is great, has 3 options between silent, normal and powerful which can be adapted for each room if required. App is great and very user friendly. Has the ability to do partial cleaning (pick a room) or just draw a square and it will do that area, or the whole floor and then returns to base once its almost out of charge or finished. Works in the dark too so you can turn it on whilst you are sleeping.\n\nVery very impressed with this product given the low price range, it is way better than cheaper models which don't have mapping technology or anti-collision. Only 1 very small downfall of this product is that only 1 person can log into the app at once. Not a huge deal, but sometimes if my wife logs in it logs me out. If that is the only negative comment I have, they clearly have done a good job with this one!"

Once you get used to the quirky software, you can map up to three areas and set no-go zones where needed, which is very convenient. Customer support was very friendly too.\nThe only negatives are that the mopping function isn\u2019t that great; I mean it doesn\u2019t vigorously mop, it just drags a wet cloth over the floor, which is ok every now and then. And the software doesn\u2019t come with any instructions, so you have to figure that out or ask support. All in all, very impressive."

Moping is very light and doesn't dispense enough water even at high setting. Missed few spots while cleaning.

The 50% off voucher made it cost just over $250.\nAnd it's great it's quiet which isn't a big thing for me I schedule it to do its work generally when I'm not in.\nIt does a great job vacuuming I can tell where it's cleaned something I couldn't always see with my other robot. All the bits that end up on the kitchen floor are always cleaned not scattered over the floor.\nThe app if being used for the basic functions is great. For the more sophisticated things like saving maps is not great.\nYou can manage the robot from anywhere so you can see where it's been and if it's got stuck somewhere from work or anywhere.\nGetting stuck is something it rarely does.\nIn summary if you want a good spec robot at a good price even at full price this is one you should consider."

Mapping function is hard to understand. By default, saving a map is turned off. Stupid!
