            "Review Text": "I've had a Cyberpower PC for about 7 years and it never let me down. In 2023 I was able to play Cyberpunk 2077 on high settings even with a mere Nvidia GTX 1060 (3 GB) and that machine's now-ancient Intel i7-7700. But I felt it was time to upgrade and after a good week or two of comparisons I decided on this machine.\n\nWhat you should know right away is that this is a great computer if you're gaming at 1080 (which many sources agree is the best ratio for gaming, things get trickier at 4K and above). I ran a performance test from Cpu User Benchmark and the computer's results were \"UFO\" in all categories, the site's highest possible grade. This unit comes with an Intel i7-13700F, a 16GB Nvidia RTX 4060 ti, and 16 GB of DDR5 ram. The motherboard is an MSI Pro B760 VC wi-fi, a solid board from a reliable brand (though the parts in this computer may differ from user to user depending on what's available when it's built). This is a solid, solid machine. It might not be the same as an ultra-insane $5,000 supercomputer but if you have that kind of cash lying around you're better off sailing on your yacht anyway.\n\nThere was much talk of the RTX 4600 being an awful video card so if you're aware of that you may be reluctant to go for this build. The problem wasn't that the card itself was bad though, only that it wasn't seen as enough of a performance jump over the previous generation of cards to warrant the price. Even so, this card is specifically the 4060 *ti*, a better version of the card, and one that also has 16 GB of video ram rather than the 8 GB on the standard 4060, an amount that may soon be insufficient for gaming. This card is VERY good for gaming. In the aforementioned Cyberpunk, for example, my previous 1060 build ran the game at about 60-70 FPS with settings high and ray-tracing, a notorious FPS hog, turned off. On this new machine I ran the same game with ray tracing turned ON and every setting at maximum and averaged a fantastic 110 FPS. With ray tracing turned back off it reached as high as 145. Cyberpunk is regularly featured in tests of the most demanding modern games, so if this computer runs it that well I'm confident about its overall performance. The solid state drive also loads the game incredibly fast, about 8 seconds from clicking \"continue game\" to actually playing it, a massive jump from the 30 or so seconds it took for my previous hard drive. I'm satisfied that this computer will keep me gaming for years.\n\nOne thing that needs to be noted is the computer's CPU fan, which several users have said is inadequate. While the computer does come with just a simple air cooler, my temperatures have so far been perfectly fine. At idle (desktop, internet, etc.) I'm getting an excellent 32-35 degree average. During gameplay my average was about 70-80, with a peak at about 85. Some may think that this is overly hot but my previous build was averaging 45 at idle and about 90 for gaming and it ran for years. All the same I do understand the desire to have the best cooling to ensure the proper lifespan. Some people have said that the i7-13700 runs hot, so you may want to invest in a stronger cooler. Other reviewers mentioned getting a \"Peerless Assassin\" so I did the same. It was around $30, very affordable if you want that extra piece of mind.\n\nSetting up the computer was incredibly easy. I wondered how this would work being that the machine does not come with a dvd drive, the only way I've ever installed Windows in the past. I was quite surprised (and intrigued) by the fact that the installer comes in the form of a little paperboard USB stick. You simply snap the stick from the \"card\" that it's mounted to (don't throw it away when you open the box!), plug it into a USB slot, and turn the computer on. That's it. Windows will install, and you don't even need to mess with the BIOS or install drivers to get the computer to recognize the mouse and keyboard (which I've had to do when reformatting other computers in the past). Once running, the computer ran a program to get the drivers it needed. I didn't even have to install any Windows runtimes, something that's normally required before you can play games. Everything in this computer was just ready, plain and simple. After having gone through a month-long headache of messing with replacement parts on an unrelated computer, this was very much appreciated. Speaking of mouse and keyboard this computer comes with very nice ones, which I'll keep for backup for when my current ones break down.\n\nI don't have much more to say, really. The RGB lights are beautiful, adjustable and come with a simple remote control. The device supports wifi and is apparently bluetooth enabled. Anything I've plugged into it, from a USB headset to an Xbox1 controller, works immediately. My gaming test delivered excellent results. The computer's performance test gave back the highest rating on CPU User Benchmark. The parts are modern and the machine was incredibly easy to set up. So far I can't think of anything I don't like about this machine, and if it holds up as well as my previous Cyberpower unit I'll be happy with it for years to come.\n\nShould anything major change I'll come back and update this review. As it stands, I am more than pleased with my purchase.\n\nEDIT 12-8-23: I've received and installed the Peerless Assassin 120 cooler that I mentioned in my review and it's definitely made a significant difference in temperatures. Playing Cyberpunk 2077 with the computer's standard cooler yielded temps between about 75-95 degrees on average. With the PA cooler I'm playing the same game at an average of about 55-60, no higher (so far) than 70, and I've gained about 10 FPS in the process. If you'd like to extend the lifespan of your CPU I can now recommend replacing the stock fan with the PA 120 or another highly-reviewed cooler."

All components were seated correctly, still checked all the connections for good measure due to shipping. No damage to box either.\n\nThis thing is a beast for the price. I've been able to run every game that I play in 1440p high/ultra at a high frame rate to match my monitor, and the 16gb of vram on the 4060ti is perfect for the rendering work that I do.\n\nHighly recommend this build."

The sleek design, combined with the customizable RGB lighting, adds a nice aesthetic touch to our gaming setup.\n\nPerformance:\nThe performance is outstanding. Equipped with a high-end graphics card and a powerful processor, this PC handles the latest games on ultra settings without breaking a sweat. The gameplay is smooth, and the load times are impressively fast thanks to the SSD. You can also multi-task seamlessly, running multiple applications and streaming without any lag.\n\nOverall:\nI highly recommend the CyberPower Gaming PC to anyone looking for a high-performance gaming rig that doesn't break the bank. It has exceeded expectations in every way."

The restart and power on speeds are excellent and the fps gain is noticeable. My one issue is that the fans are slightly loud but not impossible to tune out. From a personal view, the computer wouldn't fit into my cabinet but after removing the stilts, it fit very well. The computer was designed well for games and the design is clean, colorful, and nice to look at. We bought on father's day and for the reduced price, it is very good."

Professionally packaged, excellent quick setup guide, worked seamlessly right out of the box. Fast, and silent. I transitioned from an Alienware Ryzen 5 and I'm actually much more pleased with Cyberpower PC's Gamer Xtreme VR gaming PC, a solid and elegant/cool case, 16GB GPU performance and quiet fans. Oculus connected for VR games off Steam app - very , very smooth! 100% recommend this box as setup by CyberPowerPC."

            "Review Text": "I needed to replace my ROG laptop and figured I'd buy something that can actually be updated with new hardware instead of a whole new system.\n\nThis is a great pre built that runs all my editing software; video, audio, imaging, etc. As well as runs all my games perfectly. It's also a good price over other prebuilts and while maybe you can built it yourself. Cheaper this was a great solution to buy ready to use and the pice difference wasn't so much that it didn't make sense to not just buy this great prebuilt.\n\nOccasionally the fantasy are a bit loud but normally only for a few seconds to a minute. So far under a heavy load editing or gaming it's pretty quiet. Again fans kick in for a bit to cool things off then it's quiet as a mouse again."

            "Review Text": "Upgraded from a bit of an older system (GTX 1650 Super, i5 10th Gen, 16GB DDR4 Ram) to this and I could not be happier. Anything I couldn't run well on my old computer runs super smooth now on this current PC, this includes the speed outside of games as well. The one and only complaint I have is the fans can get a bit loud during heavy loads but if you can either replace them or just get past that then this system is perfect for 1080/1440p usage. Another thing too is how easy it was to setup and how there was no bloatware pre installed whatsoever. As for the case, I personally love the tempered glass on the side which provides a really cool and aesthetically pleasing look at all the RGB. Finally, I'd like to mention the price, for 1300 this is a pretty good deal and I would really recommend it if you have no experience whatsoever with building your own PC."

All the games that were stuttering before on my previous 2060 are smooth with no frame drops. Tested with Helldivers 2 and Cyberpunk. Just what I needed. Unless something happens, it is very good specs for the sale price. Hopefully it keeps up well with next gen games made for the 5 series.\n\nUpgrades I did: I heard this unit got a bit hot, so I bought a Peerless Thermaltake cooler, and some additional ram other reviewers recommended. Bit of a pain to install, but not terrible. Its not too loud when gaming on high settings. Note: photo is post install of the new cpu cooler, it won't come like that.\n\nI appreciate the included keyboard and mouse, and wifi fin.\n\nOne thing to note: Make sure it is delivered in a secure location. They ship it in a very visually loud box, so it could be easy target for porch pirates."

Called the customer support number that came with the computer and they trouble shot for 1 hour until we found that one wire was not connected properly (by manufacturers).\n\nThe first customer support guy (not mentioning his name) hung up or was disconnected and he never called me back (although he definitely had my number). So I called again and spoke with someone else. Reconnected the wires and the lights work now. I asked the the tech guy how to change the colors on the computer from rainbow to different colors and he said they don't know how to do that. He gave me a number for Asus the software company and they didn't know how to do that either. What a waste of time!!! Why aren't customer tech support trained to know the product? So I am stuck with rainbow colors. Not the end of the world, but there is a way to control the colors, but I can't figure it out... And got no help.\n\nBesides that, computer seems to work fine!\nP.S. The one exhaust fan isn't enough though."

PC has no problems running anything at all so far and shipped to my house a day early! So far i\u2019ve run OverWatch 2, Dead By Daylight, and Zenless Zone Zero at 144FPS & High Graphic settings with no problems at all.\n\nThere was a bit of screen tearing on OverWatch 2 when I first played it, but that was because OverWatch has G-Sync disabled by default. Enable G-Sync and the tearing disappears.\n\nThe PC is also absolutely silent. Even when the fan settings ramp up, it\u2019s still reasonably quiet to the point the games it\u2019s running at low volume are still louder than the fans. Totally satisfied with the PC so far, loving it for my first gaming PC. No cooling issues at all yet either."

I've been using DLSS whenever i get the chance to get an even smoother experience. I bought this to replace a computer i purchased two years ago that had a GTX 1650 in it. The difference between that and the RTX 4060 16GB is night and day! This is a awesome PC for gaming on a budget. The only drawback is the 16GB of RAM i will be upgrading to 32 ASAP."

The cheap cpu cooler is extremely lacking. In game it hits temps of 90+ degrees and actually crashed playing cod mw3. During cinebench it would hit 100c immediately and thermal throttle. Adjusted bios settings and got it stable enough to run but still sits around 85-90 degrees. Have a Thermalright cooler on the way and it should take care of that issue.\n\nThe lighting is cool, but had to install a 3rd party app to control it as armoury crate is a joke and refuses to work.\n\nPros- The computer is a beast and currently turned down it runs cod mw3 over 100fps and world of warships at around 200fps 1080p. With the new cooler it should be even better!\n\nCons- only cons I have is the cpu cooler and the fact it only comes with a single 16gb ram card."

That would mean that someone knew the back was dented in, they stuck it in a box anyway and shipped it. Says a lot about the seller. As for the PC, I haven't played anything yet that couldn't have all the video settings maxed out. This thing comes with a decent keyboard and mouse too which, you don't see often. It uses NMVe storage so, things load up extra fast. Hardcore gamers will tell you it needs more RAM and while more RAM is always better, I still think 16 GB is a great starting point. I'd recommend this device to anyone trying to get into PC gaming."

You can't beat them for the value - they really do offer some of the latest CPU's and GPU's for the same price that it would cost YOU to scratch build the same system from parts. I recommend using Passmark's website to look up CPU / GPU performance and compare models. Now my 4 kids are able to game together on one of the latest and most intensive video games (Helldivers) with very high graphics settings. Full disclosure - I did upgrade the oldest machine, which again was about 8 years old... but the upgrade was easy. This latest machine that I bought and that I'm mainly reviewing here is a stinkin' hot rod!"

I quickly took a very strong liking to it and after months of trying to run games on my school laptop and deciding that a pc was an investment I found worth it for not only an improved gaming experience, but also to better run the programs I use for school. My friends are much more knowledgeable about pcs then I am, so I had them help me look for everything I needed. This was the tower I ended up choosing. My friends were extremely jealous because according to them, it has significantly better features and additional features compared to theirs and was hundreds of dollars cheaper. After looking at a surplus of reviews and doing some research and comparing, this was being shipped. It arrived and was packaged very securely, so that was a big relief. It was relatively light, came very well packaged, and was a struggle (in a good way) to get out of the box. It was also very easy to assemble and get set up and running. The only downside was that the warning sticker on the glass side panel does not come off easily. My and multiple friends tried peeling it off, but the colorful exterior and sticky stuff kept separating, so I now have a dead stickler stuck to the glass of my tower (If anyone has any safe ways to get this off without doing any damage, please let me know because I am terrified). Combining this tower and the monitor that I have, I am easily able to run games with some of the highest graphic settings, easily can hit over 400 fps, and my latency typically stays between 24-37. Overall, I really enjoy it and my unknowledgeable self thinks it works great :)"

His first one has been running for years and it still does run great, he's only needed to replace it as his gaming needs have changed and the industry evolved. We both purchased the same one and are loving the upgrades! We looked around a bit and found this to have the best specs in our budget, even when we turned to custom built. Other reviews are right about the sound of the fan though, and I think it will be healthier in the long run for the PC if we upgrade it to the one a lot of the other reviews are recommending, the Peerless Assassin. If you search the reviews for it, you'll see other reviews with more info on it."

I found this CyberPowerPC GXiVR8040A14 on a Prime Day deal, and I took a chance on it. I couldn't find much information about the hardware (I'm assuming not all builds have identical hardware), but from what I could tell the CPU and GPU would meet my needs. I will be upgrading RAM and Storage, and from reading other reviews, I'll be upgrading the CPU cooling fan as well. The machine right out of the box is a solid build and would probably meet most people's needs.

I normally would have tried to build my own PC, but after speccing this out on PCpartpicker, I couldn't beat the price of the CyberPowerPC pre-built machine. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a powerful machine at a reasonable price!!!"

After countless searching and reading, this model definitely has stood out. First impressions after receiving it are that it is sleek, and exactly what I was looking for. Set-up was SUPER simple (I use Apple for my other computer, so that is something I was worried about) and it even came with a wi-fi extender. Not to mention, that it is a better model than I could have gotten at my local Best Buy for this price. 10/10 reccommend!"

I had my son upgrade the memory and cooling fam. He said there was no way he could have built me one with comparable components for the offered price. It was the easiest computer I've ever had to set up. It's quiet and the benchmark test results are amazing. I was at the point where my old computer wouldn't run some new games, but this one handles everything with ease. You'll definitely want to replace the fan it comes with, though.

This is my first ever time buying a PC for gaming purpose. By far I have been playing Warzone, Apex and my son has been playing Beamng Drive and Forza horizon 5 , no problem whatsoever.\nThe only issues I have encountered was I had a few crashes during Warzone, but the PC itself come with good specs it should handle these games easy so I think its probably caused by CPU high temp . After reading through other buyers comments and recommendations I decided to replace the stock fan . Yea this FAN is loud once I launch a game , like loud enough for me to worry about the CPU gets burnt . I did not enjoy that noise at all ! So I purchased Peerless Assasin 120 SE rgb and replaced the stock fan , I have to say its so worth it ! Now my PC is quiet even when I play games !I'm so glad I did listen to other ppl and did this, I'd suggest you do the same .\nIf it wasn't for the loud stock fan issue I would have rated it 5 stars cos that cost me extra money and my time trying to fix it. And then I spent more money purchased extra memory cards (This pc comes with 16g DDR5 memory ,I upgraded it to 32g).\nOverall It is a nice computer ,I do recommend it ."
