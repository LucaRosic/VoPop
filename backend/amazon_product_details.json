I have used them every day for a lot of years. Same great quality, better flavors than any other brand of lip ointment. Keeps my lips soft and supple all day. I highly recommend this pack if you love soda. The coke really smells like coke, and the other flavors smell just like the name on them. Great value, less than what I pay in stores."

Here's a breakdown of my experience:\n\nPros:\n1. **Fun Assortment**: I love the variety of Coca-Cola flavors included in the set. It's a fun way to switch up my lip balm flavor.\n2. **Hydrating & Protecting**: The lip balms are very moisturizing and provide great protection against dry lips.\n3. **Vegan**: As a vegan, I appreciate that these lip balms are cruelty-free and vegan-friendly.\n4. **Compact & Portable**: The small size makes them perfect for carrying in my purse or pocket wherever I go.\n\nCons:\n1. **Scent Overpowering**: While I love the scent of Coca-Cola, I found that the scent of the lip balms can be a bit overpowering at times.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the Lip Smacker Coca-Cola Flavored Balm set to anyone looking for a fun and moisturizing lip balm option. Just be aware that the scent can be quite strong."

I was a bit nervous to try these as I hadn't used them since I was super super young but I am super surprised and pleased. The scents smell super good. Now the chapstick itself, has my lips feeling super soft and I don't find myself wanting to reapply it every 5 seconds or find my lips feeling bumpy or anything. I love these lip balms alot and will definitely find myself buying more in the future. I recommend these no matter what age you might be. Also, I ordered these ones and a pack of the hello kitty ones and they all arrived safe and sound and I recommend that pack to"

Each lip balm smells exactly like the fizzy drinks we all know and love, and the flavors are spot on!\n\nNot only are these lip balms fun and cute, but they also do wonders for my lips. They're incredibly moisturizing and hydrating, leaving my lips feeling soft and smooth all day long. Plus, knowing that they're vegan makes me feel even better about using them.\n\nThe assortment of flavors is fantastic, offering a variety of options to suit any mood or craving. Whether I'm in the mood for classic Coca-Cola or a refreshing Sprite, there's a lip balm for every occasion.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with this purchase. The Lip Smacker Coca-Cola Flavored Balm set is a must-have for any lip balm enthusiast or Coca-Cola fan. Highly recommend!"

Lip Smacker is my absolute favorite brand and this package is my absolute favorite go-to for great lip balms. All the flavors rock, and this package is an incredibly good variety of the best of the best. Only Walmart has it at the same price point if it's in stock. Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper and Grape are my fave of faves, but I love all of them. There is no bad flavor in this pack. I but several packs a year and have it on subscription. In fact last year, Amazon kept telling me it would ship late or be unavailable, so I asked my office boss for Lip Smackers in my stocking (she does stocking stuffers every year), I saw a pack in stock at Walmart and got it, just in case, and the next day my Amazon subscription miraculously arrived. I got 3 of these packs in 2 days! I was over the moon! That'll hold me for six months. LOL! For real, I am obsessed with Lip Smackers and this pack in particular. Absolutely freakin' recommended!"

I was hesitant but wanted to try flavored lip balm and this was a brand a remembered from my childhood. (Plus I like the smell of Chapstick brand but the taste is awful to me). So I took a chance and learned a little more after getting them. 1st thing was the smell and taste is awesome and spot on! It's like a lingering taste of crisp Coca-Cola on your lips, the fruit ones are on pointe as well. I found myself constantly smacking my lips (hence the name! lol) as it was a neat surprise that the flavor and smell stays longer than 5 minutes.\n\nWell one night after using them and smacking my lips all day, I had settled down to watch a movie. Then my upper lip started tingling. At first I was thinking that they were right, it does have a slight tingling sensation, then I realized that I'd been licking at my lips all day, and sat down to a bowl of salty popcorn. My lips were extra sensitive from playing with them all day with the Lipsmackers and the salt cause a slight irritation! Later on, no more tingling, and that's only because I had made my own lips tender by going overboard being amazed at how much they tasted like the soda they represented.\n\nMy lips have been smoother and I have cut down on licking my lips all day when I use this balm! I'm glad I tried, and now I realize that the people said it was \"burny\" might just have done the same thing I did, licked their lips like crazy then had some salt or vinegar, some food substance that caused a little irritation. ***At least for me, I know it was my own fault and not the Lipsmackers!***\n\nIn the future, I would definitely get these again! I'm saying bye-bye to my long history of being chained to Chapstick and back to where I was when I was a kid, the world of yummy tasting Lipsmackers! :D (My favorites are the Coca-Cola, Fanta Strawberry and Root Beer: You'll be amazed at how much they smell and taste like the soda they represent!)"

(Ok, maybe I am overstating it, but for it did!) I have always suffered from dry lips, and after just a few times of them getting so dry and cracked bits were peeling painfully off of my lips, I knew I had to change something. I've tried Chapstick (too waxy), I've tried EOS (too awkward), I've tried Burt's Bees (taste funny), I've tried Carmex (too greasy and comes off too easily), and...the list goes on. Lip Smackers are my absolute go-to--and sooooo many fun flavors and scents. They offer a light gloss that I can wear over my lipstick, or just on it's own. I literally have one in every room of my house! They last a long time, aren't waxy, smell great, and are fun! After using Lip Smacker for 51 years, I ain't gonna stop now! Oh, and the Dr. Pepper is my absolute favorite!"

My husband lovingly teased me for them when the pack first showed up, but it's become a game for him now over the last few weeks to guess which flavor I have on and it's adorable. They work well, too. I do not like putting most things on my skin or lips, I don't touch most name brand balms, but these are actually nice."

I thought they'd like this flavored chap stick and so I divided the package evenly between my boys (ages 7 and 4) and put it in their stockings as a last-minute addition. Let me tell you - this was the sleeper hit of Christmas. The boys went NUTS over these, comparing the flavors they got. They designated special spots where they store their chap sticks, and they negotiate borrowing each others' flavors. Here we are - nearly two months after Christmas - and I'm writing this review because they are STILL raving over this gift. Don't think about it, just get this for your kids. It's an inexpensive gift that is most definitely worth every penny!"

Your lips feel like silk after applying it and they go on extremely softly as well. And I love the fact that none of them actually leave a bright or bold color on your lips, they just leave a beautiful shine! It doesn't matter If the chapstick itself is pink, purple, or brown- it will only leave a silky shine on your lips so they match any outfit and any make up style. Highly recommend them!!!!!"
