            "Review Text": "I ordered 2 - different colors - one came as a Gen 1 and the other is a Gen 2 (didn't realize there were different generations?)\n\nMy 7 and 8 year olds are in tears because they keep their tamagotchis heath and hunger meters full, but never fails, day 3 they start frantically beeping with a skull suddenly die. Once this beeping happens, theres no way to stop it. Dead. Reset, repeat. Day 3 dies for no reason. I don't remember this happening with the Tamagotchis in the 90s. What a waste of money.\n\nI googled and a ton of forums say the same thing is happening to them with Gen 1 and Gen 2, which apparently is what these are. Some say you can't feed it snacks ever. (Dumb, then why is there a snack button then and why is this not mentioned in the instructions??). I don't remember not being able to feed snacks in the 90s. So after the second restart (waste of 6 days, and kids in tears) one of my kids tried to not feed snacks. Still dies for no reason on day 5.\n\nI want my money back. These are a waste of my kids time."

Easy to use and set up - hers grew from a baby to teen to and then two more times to get to an adult. It did take a lot of work and if she didn't catch a sickness right away, it did die pretty quick. She loved feeding and watching it's happiness levels. The range of designs it comes in is great too! We look forward to seeing what we can do with amount of feeding and such to see if we can get different adults. It is a keeper and I would buy it again."

The loudness is obnoxious, but we figured out how to shut that off. I babysat while she was in school. Just before it evolved into an adult, the \u201cB\u201d button stopped working, so we couldn\u2019t care for it and it died. Even I was disappointed after putting so much time and energy into caring for it. I pulled the battery out and reset it, but hours later the same thing happened. Fortunately, we can still return it since we haven\u2019t had it long. I\u2019m not impressed with his boring it really is."
