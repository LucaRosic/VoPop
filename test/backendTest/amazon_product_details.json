Recently my 5 year old started playing with them and really enjoyed it. I thought I'll upgrade, and it was the best decision! Blocks are amazing in a sense theatre you can build on top of each other without them toppling over! We'll, rest is upto your - *cough cough* I mean to your little one's imagination \ud83d\ude09\nOh, it even comes with small balconies for your castle!"

They stick to the door fridge and very well to each other. They are lots of fun even tho she can\u2019t make the cool shapes yet. I would say they are great for kids of all ages."

At first her buildings were very simple but as time goes by she\u2019s building more sophisticated designs, expanding into multiple layers.

The set came with a little booklet full of ideas for builds, as well as a carrying case, though we don\u2019t use the carrying case since they stay at home anyway. They\u2019re also surprisingly durable for how often they\u2019re dropped and/or accidentally stepped on by the kids."

I have purchased 3 packs of Coodoo tiles and we have so many fences(?) and plastic porches(?) that just sit in the bin because we don\u2019t need them. Other than that, the colors are bright and the tiles are VERY durable. EASY CLEAN UP! My kids love them!"

They are very fun and can be educational to. I love the little insert pieces to make balconies and stuff if your building the castle. It makes it more immersive for the kids. It's the little things that make their day. These will keep my kids entertained for hours and honestly me and my wife enjoy them as well. They fit together nicely to. Sometimes you have to flip a piece so they magnetize right but that should be expected. If you are considering these for a Christmas or birthday present I would highly recommend them. I would even recommend you get two or three sets to make the fun last even longer. You won't regret buying these. Also the little trains included make it even more immersive for the kids. They love making crazy cars."

However because they aren't used to building with them, all their builds easily collapse and they get frustrated. My oldest has figured out how to use them after some trial and error but my younger son always has whatever he is building collapse which leads to many tears. So definitely recommend this more for older kids."
