Recently my 5 year old started playing with them and really enjoyed it. I thought I'll upgrade, and it was the best decision! Blocks are amazing in a sense theatre you can build on top of each other without them toppling over! We'll, rest is upto your - *cough cough* I mean to your little one's imagination \ud83d\ude09\nOh, it even comes with small balconies for your castle!"

They stick to the door fridge and very well to each other. They are lots of fun even tho she can\u2019t make the cool shapes yet. I would say they are great for kids of all ages."

At first her buildings were very simple but as time goes by she\u2019s building more sophisticated designs, expanding into multiple layers. It\u2019s very interesting to see the increasing sophistication in her building."

The set came with a little booklet full of ideas for builds, as well as a carrying case, though we don\u2019t use the carrying case since they stay at home anyway. They\u2019re also surprisingly durable for how often they\u2019re dropped and/or accidentally stepped on by the kids."

I have purchased 3 packs of Coodoo tiles and we have so many fences(?) and plastic porches(?) that just sit in the bin because we don\u2019t need them.

Your creations won't fall apart as easily as other sets I've tried. The other great thing is that the magnets are sealed within the plastic, I don't need to worry about the magnets getting swallowed by the baby!\n\nComes with a storage bag which is a very welcome addition.\n\nRecommended!"

They are very fun and can be educational to. I love the little insert pieces to make balconies and stuff if your building the castle. It makes it more immersive for the kids. It's the little things that make their day. These will keep my kids entertained for hours and honestly me and my wife enjoy them as well. They fit together nicely to. Sometimes you have to flip a piece so they magnetize right but that should be expected. If you are considering these for a Christmas or birthday present I would highly recommend them. I would even recommend you get two or three sets to make the fun last even longer. You won't regret buying these. Also the little trains included make it even more immersive for the kids. They love making crazy cars."

The product itself is decent quality but no longer is a Christmas gift as my 5 year old was immediately able to recognize it since it came in no packaging at all other than the original. Buyer beware if ordering for Christmas or a gift."

So I gave this to him the following day and he is over the moon. The pieces are big enough for small hands, magnets works well and lots of fun ideas came up when I gave it to him. He was able to make lots of things while working on it. We even took it our so he can stick it on our garage door. Lots of pieces in each pack which causes lots and lots of opportunities for endless play, creativity and development of fine motor skills. The price is cheaper than the original brand so I\u2019d say get it. The quality is the same."

For the most part, you can mix-and-match the sets to create larger buildings and such. I use them in a residential school environment and kids of all ages really love building with these magnetic tiles. This particular set has bases with wheels so you can create a train.\n\nThis set is made in China and being sold by Chinese company on Amazon. At the current price of fifty bucks I\u2019m sure as well over twice the price it should be. Look around for the best price per-tile before purchasing."

We have a lot of different sets in different colors but I\u2019d never seen a set include balconies until this one! Since my kids love building hotels and castles the balcony pieces are so cool for them! All you do is attach one of the four balcony designs to an open square piece and voila! I love that this set includes the car pieces as well as varying shapes and colors. A really great set for a beginner or a veteran!"

My husband is almost 50 and loves these as well. The colors are vibrant and each piece feels substantial. The magnets are also very strong.\n\nI love sets like these because it's open-ended, no rules, and it sparks imagination. Every time we play, it's slightly different. My daughter enjoys making little blueprint houses and adding her dollhouse furniture. My husband enjoys building high skyscrapers. I personally like making a house of \"cards\" that I know won't blow over.\n\nAnything magnet is awesome. But when you add a variety of color and pieces, it just makes for a great time."

The plastic is very strong with built-in magnets. Some versions of these have weak magnets of very little magnets. This brand uses strong magnets along the edges.\n\nThe price is also nice. As many of you may know, STEM toys are not cheap. They are very expensive, and to get a good price, you are probably buying a small set. This is a large 100 piece set, nicely packaged into the box, for a descent price.\n\nGreat for children, teachers, or homeschooled. Also nice for adults who like to build..."

There were some new things for us in this set, including the cars, the smaller rectangles, \"E\" shaped tiles, and the window balconies that clip into the squares. One thing that is different with these is the larger size of the opening in the squares. This means that the plastic, nonmagnetic window balconies only fit into the squares that came with this set. The outer dimensions are the same, so the magnets still line up to be used together that way. The other difference is that the magnets in these are bigger and stronger. I first noticed that they held together more firmly, and so then I looked and saw the larger magnets. The price is comparable to similar tiles, but this set has some more unique pieces and stronger magnets, making it an even better value."

I've been collecting sets of them for a year or two now because I've got 3 kids close in age so I'm always trying to find toy options that fit the following criteria:\n\n1. Great for multiple ages.\n2. Able to be used in as many ways as a child can imagine.\n3. Aesthetically pleasing for not only the kids but for ME; my children share this house too so I want them to have their \"stuff\" easily accessible but I also don't want to stare at ugly junk that doesn't actually engage the kids for more than 30 seconds.\n4. Good enough quality that I can expect all 3 kids to use them often without having things break often.\n\nThis really hits all 4 categories.\n\nMy youngest is 1; he loves the sound of dumping these out, breaking apart creations, or looking through them. My spouse is 37; he loves getting challenged to build specific things (like a \"monkey robot\") and then spending a full hour building massive things for the kids. We ALL enjoy playing with magnetic tiles.\n\nWe've been able to make ball runs, animals, houses/castles, huge rainbows, small world set ups... They stick to the fridge AND our doors so we use them in vertical ways too, like covering an entire door with them or seeing how far OUTWARD we can build before it's too heavy.\n\nThey're beautiful. The colors are vibrant, they're not sharp enough for the corners to hurt (as a mom of 3 boys I've seen the strangest things become WMD in this house), they match other brand sets of similar tiles, they're easy to spot AND easy to clean up (I just stack them together as I go since they stick together.)\n\nI haven't had this set for long, but I do have another set from the same brand (and a few other sets from other brands) and with daily, heavy use, we've had 2 tiles break in the last few YEARS. In both situations it was due to a grown man accidentally stepping on one while wearing boots. We use these a lot and they've managed to last through soooo much abuse.\n\nThis set is the perfect birthday gift for kids of any age. Once you start playing with them it becomes addictive and you'll want more and more so you can build bigger things. We probably have 400+ at this point and we never, ever run out of ways to use them. And this one comes with a booklet of ideas, and you can find tons of cool inspiration and creations with a quick search online. The possibilities are literally endless."

I also work with elementary school children who are crazy about the magnet tiles at the learning center. Bottom line, magnet tiles are sure winners with children of all ages, and this particular large set is really great.\nWith most magnet tile sets you don't get the little magnetic cars, but this set has two. That along with the large quantity of quality tiles you get makes this set an easy 5 star winner. Well made with strong magnets that won't fall out, combined with the variety of shapes and bright colors makes this set one my grandchildren will totally enjoy adding to their collection. And I can rest assured they'll be safe playing with the pieces.\nIf you want to make a child happy, this set will do it. Totally giftable and the price is right."

None of my other sets have the balcony pieces.\n\nAlso included is a direction booklet with ideas for building, and a drawstring bag for storage. I actually just like to throw all my magnetic blocks in a large clear plastic bin with a cover on it.
